# ePortfolio_public
Public repository for the ePortfolio application. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** 

The ePortfolio application project was created for the CIS2430 Object Oriented Programming course offered in Fall 2021 at the University of Guelph and as result of that Dr. Fei Song (the instructor of the course) shares it's ownership. Since Dr. Song intends to use a similar assignments for later iterations of his course, he has refused the request to share the code in a public repository. 

If you are interested in looking at the entire project, please feel free to contact me at `rashi@uoguelph.ca` and I will grant access to the private repository that hosts this project within 24 hours of the request. 

Please note that the code is for demonstration purposes only and cannot be copied, reused or resubmitted as orginal work in any context. 

Thank you!!
